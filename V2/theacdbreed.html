    <td><p>The Australian Cattle Dog was developed in Australia in the 1800s.
	Australia’s first cattle dogs were British imports of a breed known as the Smithfield.
	Smithfields were crossed with Dingoes (native wild australian dogs) and other breeds
	A key contributor to the effort was George Elliot, of Queensland, 
	who bred Dingoes with Collies and sold the puppies to farmers.
	<p>Eventually,true perfection was achieved when two brothers, Jack and Harry Bagust,
	bred Dalmatians with some of Elliott’s ACDs.
	The Australian Cattle Dog was admitted to the AKC in 1980
	and became a charter member of the AKC Herding Group upon the founding of the group in 1983.
