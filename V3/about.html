<p>Version 1: I have created my first webpage about the Australian Cattle Dog.
 I created 4 pages to include Home, About, the Breed and Care.
 The css compliments the html and gives it structure. There are 
navigational links and hyperlinks for additional iformation 
about Australian Cattledogs.

<p>Version 2: I have made some adjustments in the general layout of my webpage.
I added a background image and a tables on the breed page.
 I also added some responsive html and css to the images to make the pages more interactive. 
I have organized the layout and content as to where everything is somewhat cohesive.
I added another page Resources.The css compliments the html and gives it more structure.</p>
